# <p align="center"> Phase Two Project <p align="center">

In the Phase Two group project of the Innovation Fellowship at The Knowledge House, our team adeptly leveraged Amazon Web Services (AWS) to design and develop a comprehensive cybersecurity lab. As the Project Manager, I had the opportunity to write and edit technical documentation and contribute to the development of the infrastructure's intricacies. 

Key facets of this project encompassed establishing Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), forging VPC Peering, and seamlessly integrating pivotal tools such as Splunk EC2, Kali Linux, pfSense, and Metasploitable. The culmination of these efforts has yielded a fortified environment, meticulously crafted for both offensive and defensive security measures. This repository includes works that I either created exclusively or had significant collaboration on, ensuring the quality and integrity of the content shared. This serves as a testament to our endeavors, encapsulating elements like SIEM, IPS, IDS, an exploitative machine, and a static IP website, further augmented with a coherent topology and an in-depth cost analysis report.
