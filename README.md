This repository contains the elements of my contribution to the Phase 2 project as a Cybersecurity & Networking Fellow in the Innovation Fellowship at The Knowledge House.  This project involved creating a functional Cybersecurity Lab within Amazon Web Services installing and utilizing SIEM, VPC, VPC Peering, IPS, Offensive Security, IDS, Exploitive System and a Static IP website.  This lab also utilizes a topology and a cost analysis report.
