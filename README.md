# phase2cybersecrepository
This repository contains the following from my contributions as group leader to the end of Phase 2 project within the Innovation Fellowship at The Knowledge House.  This project involved creating a functional Cybersecurity Lab within Amazon Web Services. Included in this repository are:
    -Partial Documentation of VPC Creation, Peering Connection and IAM Access including screenshots written and edited by me.    
    -Google link to a video documenting various terminals SSH-ing into their relative EC2 instance and using the ICMP IPv4 security group rule to ping between EC2 instances.  This video also shows the web interfaces for: Splunk, pfSense, Snort and Wordpress.  This video was complied, created and edited by me.
